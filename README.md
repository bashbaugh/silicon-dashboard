A futurisitic sci-fi-themed Chrome dashboard

Are you tired of the boring new tab page in your browser? Why not get a project management and productivity dashboard with a super cool futuristic theme instead?

### Features

Here are a few of the features

### Futuristic design principles

In order to make the dashboard as scifi/cyberpunk-themed as possible, here are some of the admittedly subjective design prinicples I've followed:

+ \\\ lots of slashes
+ CAPITALIZATION and UNDERSCORED_TEXT
+ Beveled fonts; lightweight fonts
+ Dark blue, black, and space-themed backgrounds
+ numbers, stats, and charts
+ Technical-sounding naming
+ Complex animations
+ Futuristic sound effects
